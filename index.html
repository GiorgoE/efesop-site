          <p>My main passion is functional, user centered design; <span class="italic bold">I like to design things that do their job properly and still look beautiful.</span> That’s why I am creating a multi-page CV and giving each section the room it deserves. I believe knowing what your users want and need before you start the design process is especially important.

          I’m a hard working person, always looking for new challenges and working to accomplish them. After I finished university I took a small break from digital work to get some hands on experience with real people. In that break I did retail and then door to door charity fundraising work both of which taught me the meaning of teamwork. I also run my own business as a leather artisan and I’m currently in conversation with some magazines to have my products featured in their catalogues.

          I have previous experience in building responsive websites from scratch as well as using CMS’s. I also created a some games that run in the web browser; a space invaders ‘clone’ and a text based adventure game. I do a little freelance work and I have recently moved back to Bournemouth after travelling to restart my pursuit of a digital career. I’ve just completed a ‘UX & Web Design Master Course’ online and I am willing to learn more and work hard if I get given the opportunity.
