        <p class="center-standout"><span class="highlight">I am George Efesopoulos, I am a visual designer with a focus on digital. I have been a student of design for the past 10 years, I have a degree in ‘Digital Media Design’ and I have previously worked for 2 full service digital agencies as an all-round digital designer and front-end developer.</span></p>

          <p>My main passion is functional, user centered design; <span class="italic bold">I like to design things that do their job properly and still look beautiful.</span> That’s why I am creating a multi-page interactive web CV and giving each section the room it deserves. I believe knowing what your users want and need before you start the design process is especially important in creating the best product.

          <br>
          I’m a hard working person, always looking for new challenges and working to accomplish them. After I finished university I took a small break from digital work to get some hands on experience with real people. In that break I did retail and then door to door charity fundraising work both of which taught me the meaning of teamwork. I also ran my own business as a leather artisan before eventually getting a job as a Digital Designer at UNBXD, a full service digital agency catering to businesses in the Bournemouth area.
          <br>
          <br>
          Whilst at UNBXD I spent most of my time designing content and creating websites for their clients. This included liasing with the clients as well as producing a high standard of work on a regular schedule. Most of the websites we created for clients were built using CMS platforms such as wordpress, shopify and squarespace. So I have experience with those as well as experience coding fully responsive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also have experience with a plethora of other softwares that I've picked up and tried over the years. I've created small games in the web browser as well as in unity using C#. I've created infographics and motion graphics using After Effects. I've designed, modelled, textured, animated and rendered 3D models using Autodesk Maya and Vray as well. I basically spend most of my free time trying to get my hands on new technologies and software to see how they work and if there's anything interesting I can do with them.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm currently freelancing whilst travelling in Vietnam but I will be back in Bournemouth in February 2019 and will be interested in looking for jobs within the digital industry again.
